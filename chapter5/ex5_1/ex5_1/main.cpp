/* You are given two 32-bit numbers,N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. 
 Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i. You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is,if M= 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for example, have j-3 and i=2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.
 EXAMPLE:
 Input:N=10000000000, M=10011, i =2, j =6 Output: N = 10001001100
 
 Q1 does this assume that inside N for the places from i to j there are only zeros?
 
 shift M by i bits to the left, then perform bitwise OR
 
 100 0000 0000
 xxx x100 11xx
 
 need to keep bits from i to j: do a bitwise AND with
 111 1000 0011
